However, week-over-week analysis shows a clear reversal: weeks 1–2 had +2.0% revenue lift, but weeks 3–4 dropped to −1.5%. The initial gain likely came from advertiser budget frontloading in response to the higher floor; once budgets adjusted, fill rate degraded and revenue fell below control. The trend is moving in the wrong direction. Do not ship."
